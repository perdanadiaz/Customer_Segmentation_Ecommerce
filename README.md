# Customer_Segmentation_Ecommerce
Gustavo e-commerce needs to increase its marketing conversion rate by doing more targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget. Our task is how to create segmentation based on customer transactions and provide an action plan for each segmentation. Based on K-Means Clustering and breakdown using RFM Segmentation, we can divide it into 6 segments such as Best Customer, Active Customer, and Lost Customer, and can offer some actions like flash sales, and promo/discount to improve the Gustavo transaction.

Results : 
1. Performed customer segmentation using Python in order to determine more targeted marketing approach that will increase the companyâ€™s marketing conversion rate
2. Based on K-Means clustering and RFM segmentation breakdown, successfully divided customers into 3 segments such as high value, medium value, and low value customer, and provided specific recommendations to be implemented in each segment such as promo and discounts, referral promo, and customer loyalty program
